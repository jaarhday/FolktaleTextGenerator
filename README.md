# Overview

For this project, I developed a text generator trained on worldwide folktales. The generator is capable of producing text similar in style to the input folktales. I aimed to deepen my understanding of natural language processing techniques and recurrent neural networks by implementing this project.

The purpose of writing this software was to explore the capabilities of recurrent neural networks in generating coherent and contextually relevant text. By training the model on a diverse set of folktales, I aimed to create a text generator that could capture the essence of storytelling across different cultures.

# Development Environment

I developed the software using TensorFlow, a popular deep learning framework, and Python programming language. Additionally, I utilized TensorFlow's Keras API for building and training the neural network model.

# Future Work

- Refine the model architecture to improve text generation quality.
- Experiment with different training techniques and hyperparameters.
- Incorporate attention mechanisms to better capture long-range dependencies in the text.
- Explore techniques for controlling the style and tone of generated text.
- Deploy the text generator as a web service for interactive storytelling experiences.
